Since fitness and athletic training are important interests of mine, I decided to make my scraper a WOD scraper ("Workout Of the Day").  The Cli app will scrape the previous 7 day's worth of workouts by providing a menu of days and then the user can choose which of the days about which they would like more detailed information.  
This project took me a lot longer than I expected it would.  It's now the end of June, 2018 and I began this Cli scraper at the end of April.  Of course, the fact that I had to keep taking breaks because of work and family stuff didn't really help either, but I'm glad to at least have a version 1.0 that is passable.  
I recognized that despite following the lessons in the curriculum up to this point, there was still a lot that I didn't know in order to get the project completed.  The first thing I had to figure out was how file load paths worked.  I still don't feel fully comfortable with this concept, but at least I have a working understanding (as in "my project works so I must understand it, right?").  The second obstacle that I faced was figuring out how to synthesize and organize much of the information I've learned so far into some type of coherent gestalt.  I know what an iterator is, I know how to write one, but how exactly do I use iteration and proper CSS selection to access the exact data that I need from a series of nested Nokogiri nodes?
Using the proper CSS selectors to grab the data that I needed from my scraped file was another hairy issue.  I mean, it's been like almost a year since I finished the section on HTML and CSS.  I also had to refresh my understanding of the basic git commands for pushing to my repo (since I normally just click save in the IDE and it's automatically done for me).  Then there was the dreaded bash syntax.  Dang.  I'm kind of impressed with the jargon that I'm able to use.  I almost sound like a programmer.  Kind of.
